## üë©‚Äçüè´ Introduction to Python
This submodule introduces **Python programming for neuroscience and biomedical data analysis**.  
Students learn to write efficient, reproducible code using Jupyter Notebooks, develop an understanding of programming logic, and apply these skills to real-world datasets in neuroscience.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of the notebook, you will be able to:
- Understand and apply the fundamental syntax and structure of Python.  
- Use variables, data types, and control structures effectively.  
- Work with loops, conditionals, and user-defined functions.  
- Read, process, and visualize datasets using **NumPy**, **Pandas** and **Seaborn**.  
- Write clean, well-documented, and Pythonic code.

## üìò Contents

### **1. Let‚Äôs run our first Python code**
An introduction to Python syntax and Jupyter Notebooks.  
- Learn how to execute code cells interactively.  
- Understand indentation and line-based structure.  

### **2. Data types in Python**
Covers Python‚Äôs core data types and how to use them effectively.  
- Numeric (`int`, `float`), text (`str`), and boolean (`bool`) types.  
- Type conversion (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`) and checking (`type()`).  
- Working with collections: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.  

### **3. Arithmetic, comparison, assignment and logical operators**
Explores operators used to perform calculations and comparisons.  
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`.  
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.  
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.  
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`.  
- Practical examples combining these operators.  

### **4. Python modules**
Introduction to modular programming and the use of libraries.  
- Importing modules (`import`, `from ‚Ä¶ import`).  
- Using built-in modules like `random`, `os`.  
- Installing third-party packages via `pip`.  
- Understanding namespaces and reusability.  

### **5. Loops and conditionals**
Control flow fundamentals in Python.  
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditional statements.  
- `for` and `while` loops for iteration.  

### **6. Time to put the theory into practice**
Applies earlier concepts through mini coding challenges.  
- Writing loops and conditionals together.  
- Implementing error handling and simple debugging.  

### **7. Navigating directories and processing text files**
Introduction to working with files and folders.  
- Reading and writing files with `open()` (`r`, `w`, `a` modes).  
- Using `os` for directory navigation and file management.  

### **8. Data Science with Pandas**
A beginner-friendly overview of the **Pandas** library.  
- Creating and exploring DataFrames (`pd.read_csv()`, `.head()`).  
- Selecting and subsetting data with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`.  
- Data inspection and summary statistics (`.describe()`, `.shape`).  
- Handling missing data (`.dropna()`).  
- Plotting (`.plot()`, `.plot.bar()`, `.plot.hist()`).  
- Correlation and heatmaps using `seaborn.heatmap()`.  
- Saving processed data (`to_csv(sep="\t")`).  

### **9. Gentle introduction to NumPy**
Core numerical computing with the **NumPy** library.  
- Creating and manipulating arrays (`np.array()`, `np.arange()`, `np.zeros()`).  
- Array attributes (`.shape`, `.ndim`, `.dtype`).  
- Mathematical operations (`np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.std()`).  
- More complex functions (`concatenate()`, `convolve()`).  

### **10. Introduction to functions**
Learning to write reusable and organized code with functions.  
- Defining and calling functions, using `def` and `return`.  
- Arbitrary arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`).  
- Default parameter values.
