    "# Understanding Virtual Environments in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "When you start learning Python, one of the very important tools to understand is the **virtual environment**.\n",
    "A virtual environment is a **self-contained workspace** where you can install and manage Python libraries for a specific project, without affecting other projects or your system-wide Python setup.\n",
    "This is extremely useful when working on multiple projects that might need **different versions of the same library**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "Let's imagine two Python projects:\n",
    "* **Project A** uses `numpy==1.23`\n",
    "* **Project B** uses `numpy==1.26`\n",
    "If both rely on the same global Python installation, installing `numpy==1.26` for Project B will break Project A.\n",
    "**Virtual environments solve this problem** by creating isolated spaces for each project. In essence, you do not have to worry about uninstaling and reinstalling different versions of the same package on a compatible Python release.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## What Happens When You Create a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "When you create one, Python automatically sets up a folder (usually named `venv/` or `myenv/`) that contains:\n",
    "* A **local copy of the Python interpreter**\n",
    "* A dedicated **`site-packages/` directory** where your project's libraries are installed\n",
    "* Scripts to **activate** and **deactivate** the environment\n",
    "This setup ensures that anything you install using `pip` or `conda` inside that environment stays isolated from your global Python installation.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "Let's walk through creating and using a virtual environment from scratch.\n",
    "### Create a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `venv` (built-in Python)\n",
    "Open a terminal or command prompt in your project folder and run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "* `python -m venv` → runs Python's built-in module for creating environments\n",
    "* `venv` → is the name of the environment folder (you can call it anything)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a folder structure like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "project/\n",
    "│\n",
    "├── venv/\n",
    "│   ├── bin/ (or Scripts/ on Windows)\n",
    "│   ├── lib/\n",
    "│   └── pyvenv.cfg\n",
    "└── main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `conda`\n",
    "If you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n myenv python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "* `conda create -n myenv` → creates a new conda environment named `myenv`\n",
    "* `python=3.10` → specifies the Python version to use\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an environment managed by conda, stored in your Anaconda installation directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "Before installing packages, you must **activate** the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Windows (Command Prompt):**\n",
    "```batch\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On Windows (PowerShell):**\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**On macOS / Linux (Bash or Zsh):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**On all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll know it's active when your terminal prompt changes to show `(venv)` or `(myenv)`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(venv) $\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```\n",
    "(myenv) $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any `pip install` or `conda install` command will only affect this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `venv` with `pip`:\n",
    "You can now install libraries specific to this project using `pip`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `conda`:\n",
    "You can install libraries using conda (which also manages non-Python dependencies):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numpy pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or you can still use `pip` within a conda environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages are installed **locally** inside your virtual environment — not system-wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save Your Project Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `venv` with `pip`:\n",
    "To record the packages (and their exact versions) that your project uses, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create a file called `requirements.txt` containing something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "numpy==1.26.1\n",
    "pandas==2.1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To recreate the same environment later:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `conda`: [Getting Started with Conda (see here)](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#windows-command-prompt)\n",
    "To export your conda environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env export > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates an `environment.yml` file with all dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recreate the environment later:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also use `requirements.txt` with conda environments:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is **essential for sharing your project**, because it tells others (or your future self) exactly which packages are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate the Environment\n",
    "When you're done working:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `venv`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `conda`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns you to your system-wide Python environment.\n",
